Documentation proof-of-concept.  


This repo is meant as a hopefully-useful proof of concept for website documentation.  
All code (HTML, CSS and javascript) and all text is AI-generated.  

I'm slowly starting to get into some Zig coding, hence the text content here.  
This repo is aimed in particular at showing how the layout of the Zig Standard Library documentation 
could be improved, as that is currently (IMO) a bit cluttered and difficult to navigate, understand and
"get the big picture".   

The code (HTML, CSS and javascript) is released to the public domain under the Unlicense. 

The text content (including all Zig code within it) is released under the MIT license, as that is the 
license that Zig uses.  


***************************************************************************************************



Given that all content in this repo (except this README is AI-generated, IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT 
THIS REPO NOT BE USED AS AN ACTUAL SOURCE OF DOCUMENTATION. 
THE CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.  


The IMPORTANT thing here is the LAYOUT of the content and how easy it is to navigate around it and 
"see the big picture".   

Themes have been added to (hopefully) enhance the user-experience.  
In particular, I hope users enjoy the "PULL OVER, BUDDY!" theme............  ;)  

As mentioned, the HTML, CSS and javacript code is released to the public domain.  
"Share and enjoy....."  :)
